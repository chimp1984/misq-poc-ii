/**
 * An implementation of misq.common.handlers.ErrorMessageHandler that avoids
 * an exception loop with the UI's misq.common.taskrunner framework.
 * <p>
 * The legacy ErrorMessageHandler is for reporting error messages only to the UI, but
 * some core api tasks (takeoffer) require one.  This implementation works around
 * the problem of Task ErrorMessageHandlers not throwing exceptions to the gRPC client.
 * <p>
 * Extra care is needed because exceptions thrown by an ErrorMessageHandler inside
 * a Task may be thrown back to the GrpcService object, and if a gRPC ErrorMessageHandler
 * responded by throwing another exception, the loop may only stop after the gRPC
 * stream is closed.
 * <p>
 * A unique instance should be used for a single gRPC call.
